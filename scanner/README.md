# Scanner files

This is a collection of notes, scripts, and templates for creating QR codes from input data, e.g. driver's license.
The QR codes are read by a 2D scanner, e.g. an [NT-1228BL](https://www.amazon.com/NETUM-Bluetooth-Handheld-Wireless-NT-1228BL/dp/B07CBS52KJ/), and decoded as keyboard input for various input forms on web pages.
